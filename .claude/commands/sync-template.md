# Sync template schema

Pulls the latest schema-layer updates (hooks, slash commands, subagents, routing docs, merge drivers) from `vacuumlabs/project-template` into this repo. **Wiki content is never touched** — `client-inputs/`, `team-inputs/`, wiki folders, `log.md`, `index.md`, `decisions.md`, `contradictions.md`, and `.claude/settings.local.json` are all preserved as-is.

Follow this workflow exactly. Do not skip steps.

## 0. Sync with origin

Before doing anything else, run `git pull --ff-only --quiet` to pick up any pushes from teammates. If the pull fails (non-fast-forward, conflicts, network error), stop and ask the user to resolve before continuing.

## 1. Guard the working tree

Run `git status --porcelain`. If it returns anything, **abort** with:

> *"You have uncommitted changes. Commit or stash them first, then re-run `/sync-template`."*

This prevents sync-applied edits from being accidentally rolled up with the user's in-flight work.

## 2. Fetch the remote manifest

Read `sync-manifest.json` at the repo root to find `template_repo` and `template_branch`. Fetch the remote manifest:

```bash
curl -sfL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<template_repo>/<template_branch>/sync-manifest.json"
```

If curl fails (network error, 404, 403), report the error and abort. A 403/404 on a private template repo means the user needs `gh auth login` first — tell them.

## 3. Compare versions

Read local `sync-manifest.json` and compare `version` with remote `version`.

- **Equal:** report *"You are on template v<X.Y.Z>, same as the template. Nothing to sync."* and exit.
- **Different:** continue.

## 4. Diff every file in the remote manifest

For each path in the remote `files` array:

- Fetch the remote contents: `curl -sfL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<template_repo>/<template_branch>/<path>"`.
- Read the local file (if it exists).
- Classify the pair into one of:
  - `identical` — no action needed.
  - `changed` — remote differs from local; will overwrite on confirm.
  - `new` — file exists in remote but not locally; will create on confirm.

Also compute files to delete: any path in the **local** manifest's `files` array that is not in the **remote** manifest's `files` array. Those will be `git rm`'d on confirm.

## 5. Present the summary

Show the user:

- Version bump: `<local_version>` → `<remote_version>`
- Counts: `<N> changed, <M> new, <K> to delete`
- For each `changed` file: the path plus a compact diff stat (lines added / removed).
- For each `new` or `to delete` file: the path only.
- **Flag prominently** any file where the local version appears to have been customised locally (substantially diverged from the prior template version). For these, recommend reviewing the diff carefully before overwriting.

Ask the user to choose:
- **Apply all** — proceed with everything.
- **Pick per file** — step through each changed file and confirm or skip.
- **Cancel** — abort without writing anything.

## 6. Apply the accepted changes

For each accepted change:

- `changed` / `new`: write the fetched remote contents to the local path.
- `to delete`: `git rm <path>`.

Finally, overwrite the local `sync-manifest.json` with the remote one (this is how the local version marker advances).

## 7. Commit

Stage and commit:

```
sync: schema → template v<remote_version>

<one-line summary: "<N> files updated, <M> added, <K> removed">
```

The Stop hook will push.

## 8. Report

Return a structured summary:

- **Version:** `<local>` → `<remote>`
- **Updated:** `<list of paths>`
- **Added:** `<list of paths>`
- **Removed:** `<list of paths>`
- **Skipped** (if user picked per-file): `<list of paths>`

Do **not** append to `log.md`. The commit history and `sync-manifest.json` version are the durable record; `log.md` is reserved for wiki-content events.

## Notes

- Files NOT in the manifest are never read, written, or deleted by this command.
- If the remote manifest adds new paths, the user sees them in the `new` bucket and decides whether to accept.
- If curl is unavailable on the user's system, this command won't work — report and suggest installing it.
- For private template repos: replace the `curl -sfL` calls with `gh api repos/<template_repo>/contents/<path>?ref=<template_branch> --jq .content | base64 -d`. Detect the private-repo case when the first curl returns 404 from an otherwise-reachable host.
